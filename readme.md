## Bank-4-arg platform read me

This is a dynamic platform that utilises the Laravel framework, and was conceived to be a fictional
bank for argumentation.. The work was produce for the artist Diogo da Cruz for the exhibition [Geltung](http://agorama.org.uk)'s online component.

The platforms function is to be able to create user base app that acts like an accounts system of sorts,
which allows a user to 'deposit' something (in the case for Diogo this was arguments that the user would
write themselves) for valuation, this request is then past to a holding table where an actual admin would
have to value the 'thing' in a numerical value, which would then appear in the user's dashboard.

The second major component to the platform is the trading post (Argument Landscape menu listing on the
users dashboard), where a user is presented with other users arguments that they can only see a preview of.
A user is then able to choose whether they would like to trade one of their arguments for another's.

Please note the html/css template login and reg front page is from [AZMIND](https://azmind.com/), and the dashboard
is from Bootstraps free template range.
